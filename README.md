Iteration 1: There is a functioning login page that hooks the info to a backend and compares it for login. As well as a mostly working lunch tab and a fully functional homepage!
 - Problems were connecting the login to redirect after a corrrect user and pass were entered.
 - Learning about react dom and what each of the imports do
 - Creating a working counter for the lunch tab

FUTURE TODO
 - I would like to add a local memory to save the lunch tab
 - Create Grades and Library tab
 - Create a box to send off an email to the teacher of said student(this will be written as to go to a vcu email)
 - Make visually appealing using more css
