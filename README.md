Iteration 1: There is a functioning login page that hooks the info to a backend and compares it for login. As well as a mostly working lunch tab and a fully functional homepage! Key note :  Learning about react dom and what each of the imports do
 - USE CASE 1:
   - Planned test case of going to the lunch tab from home and clicking add then navigating off the tab
    - Creating the buttons to add up or down (closed)
    - Making sure it cannot go below 0 (closed)
    - Saving progress to the local memory (closed)
 - USE CASE 2:
    - Planned test case of logging in with the wrong username and password and seeing if it goes through. Then navigating to each tab.
       - Adding login logic that rejects if username or password is wrong (closed)
       - Adding router links to all seperate places in each tab (closed)
       - Adding ways to get back to the home tab(closed)
